# Predicting Carbon Footprints with Machine Learning

Welcome to the Predicting Carbon Footprints with Machine Learning project! This repository contains code and resources for predicting CO2 emissions based on various factors using machine learning techniques.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can predict the carbon footprint of vehicles based on various features such as engine size, number of cylinders, and fuel consumption. By accurately predicting CO2 emissions, we aim to contribute to environmental sustainability by identifying key factors that influence vehicle emissions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes features such as:
- Engine size
- Number of cylinders
- Fuel consumption
- CO2 emissions

The data is sourced from [source name or provider], and it has been preprocessed to ensure quality and consistency.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
